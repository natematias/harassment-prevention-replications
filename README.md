# Harassment Prevention Replications 2019-2020

Can norms against harassment change behavior and grow participation online? From 2019-2020, [CAT Lab](https://citizensandtech.org/about-cat-lab/) worked with online communities on Reddit to evaluate interventions tested in r/science in 2016. This repository stores drafts of the data analysis and academic pre-print reporting findings from our collaborations with r/science, r/ffxiv, and r/futurology in that period.
